# Adminity
Admin User Interface - HTML &amp; CSS template.

## Not maintained
This project is meant to serve as a time capsule to 2012, when it was first created.

It was one of the first websites I made, so it doesn't use the best practices and hasn't been updated in many years, but it may still be useful to some people. For example, if your workplace still uses IE7, feel free to grab this, as IE7 compatibility was a requirement back when this was made :)
